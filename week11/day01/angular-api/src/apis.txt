What is an api

api stands for application programming interface

-- is a set of rules and protocols for communication between programs

-- I create a program/system/serveretc., and if you want to communicate with it, here are the guidelines

-- An interface does two main things:
    1. Enforce a certain set of rules about what you can/can't do with a piece of software/class/etc.
    2. hides the details of the implementation

we don't need to know HOW the api get us the information, we just need to know that, when we ask it a certin question or make a certain request, it returns information in a certin predictable format.


To do this, the API creator provides us with endpoints
-- an endpoint is a specifically-formatted URL to which we can make a request and get back a certin type of information

Might return an array of all dog breeds including the string 'husky,', where each item in the array is an object with properties name, genus, species, color, etc.

The response object is in a consistent, prodictable format.

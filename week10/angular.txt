The angular Framework

-- Angular is a JavaScript Framework for SPA (single-page application) development
-- developed by google and udsed in all their online application

-- Incorporates JavaScript (technically TypeScript), HTML and CSS

-- a Single-page application can appear to have as many "pages" as you like from a user perspective
-- but, it really only has one under the hood
-- different "pages" are loaded into your components via a router

-- the application only loads/refreshes what has changed

-- new pages dont't make additional HTTP calls (unless they're specifically requiredd by a function, etc.)

-- in order for the application to deploy properly, Everything in every component must compile.

-- "state" is/are the current values of various properties
    -- state is maintained, and any change to state that has to do with the view will result in a change to the view    
    -- if you have a <p> tag whose content is being pulled from some JS variable, and the variable changes values,
        the view will update to reflect to new state

-- the "model" is a data from which the view is constructed
-- the "view" is what the user sees
-- when the model is updated, so is the view

-- pages are assembled from components
    -- each component consists of some TypeScript, some HTML, and some CSS
    -- each component has it own set of files
        -- HTML
        -- CSS
        -- TypeScript
        -- testing files

TO INSTALL THE ANGULAR CLI (command line interface) -- npm install -g @angular/CLI

-- npm (node package manager) grabs all the dependencies/packages that Angular needs to run
-- install 
-- -g is global install, meaning you can now access the CLI from wherever

-- Angular uses the ng prefix for all its actions, short for A-ng-ular

-- to create a new project, navigate to where you want it to live (it will create it's own folder)
    -- then type ng new <projectName>

-- to create a server to launch your site
    --ng serve
    --ng serve --open // wil open a browser window
    --ng serve --live-reload

-- if you download an Angular app which has gitignored the dependencies
    -- navigate to root directory and turn this -> npm i


// inside your app
.getignore - all the things that wont be uploaded to githum 
.package-jason = keeps track of all your software dependencies
        (software your app uses in the background)
